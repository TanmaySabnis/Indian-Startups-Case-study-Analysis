For any project in the DS domain, the first step is 'Scoping' which means asking the right questions related to the improvement of the business domain.

In this small project, I have performed exhaustive data analysis or 'scoping' the right questions before arriving at the right conclusions.
This enabled me to learn all the essential EDA skills.
